# AMP


Here is all of the code that I use for the Amphibian Microbiome Project! The main pipline that I use is Qiime, which already does a good job of showing what you've done throught the provenance of it's artifacts, but I hope that these help my collaborators see just exactly what i'm doing, and allows them to recreate whatever files they'd like.
